* Checklists for the remainder of the project

** TODO Project Evaluation [3/15]

  - [X] Look at using a code coverage tool

  - [X] Gather more test data (more Gutenbergs and random data)

  - [ ] Extend unit tests to work on more data and have more coverage

  - [-] Define QuickCheck properties for each module [6/12]

    - [X] ORAM

    - [X] Stash

    - [X] PosMap

    - [X] Node

    - [ ] BTrees

    - [ ] FS

    - [ ] InodeIndex

    - [X] Bitarray

    - [ ] FreeMap

    - [X] Inode

    - [ ] InvertedIndex

    - [ ] SearchClient

  - [ ] Identify any parameters that could use optimisation and perform
        experiments to test these

    - [ ] Bucket Size

    - [ ] Levels of recursion

  - [X] Begin performance testing by examining options (Core_bench vs. own
        profiling)

  - [ ] Perform experiments that compare overhead due to ORAM

    - [ ] Do time overhead experiment

    - [ ] Do max stash size experiment in parallel

    - [ ] Figure out how to do bandwidth overhead

  - [ ] Compare bandwidth overhead of recursive vs. non-recursive

  - [ ] Find file system benchmarks and run those for standardisation

  - [ ] Try and identify slowest section in order to focus optimisation

  - [ ] Figure out what we actually mean by randomness in the context of ORAM

  - [ ] Test uniformly writing/reading to a single address having randomness

  - [ ] Do regression tests between the same and different access patterns

** DONE Write Progress Report [4/4]
   CLOSED: [2016-01-29 Fri 17:32]

  - [X] Start LaTeX document for progress report

  - [X] Read Project Briefing Document to find our content needs

  - [X] Write necessary content

  - [X] Submit progress report (29/01/16)

** TODO Project Presentation [4/4]

  - [X] Read Project Briefing Document section about presentation

  - [X] Prepare slides for presentation

  - [X] Practice the presentation in head before this Wednesday (for Improbable)

  - [X] Do presentation on right day at right time
